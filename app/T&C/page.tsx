                However, if you ordered size 10 and received the correct size as
                per your order but later wish to exchange for a larger size,
                this is not possible, as we clearly specify the maximum
                available size (size 10) before purchase. Similarly, if you
                order size 6 and wish to replace it with size 5 (which is
                smaller), this is also not possible. Please keep this in mind
                while placing your order.
